## Mass Shooting and Gun Control
Since the most recent Las Vegas shooting, the issue of gun control is once again thrust into the spotlight of American political debate and public discourse. Have we succumbed to compassion fatigue? Is the media paying continuous attention to gun control? Does the public follow the media? In this project, I combine three datasets to explore the relationship between mass shooting, media attention, and public interest in gun control.

I present and discuss my preliminary findings [here](https://github.com/roxydu/gun/wiki/plots).
