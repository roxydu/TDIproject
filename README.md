Since the most recent Las Vegas shooting, the issue of gun control is once again thrust into the spotlight of American political debate and public discourse. Has the public become numb and indifferent toward news of mass shooting and gun violence? Is the media paying more or less attention to gun violence? These are important questions to answer, if we care about the future of gun regulation and public safety in America. In this project, I combine three datasets to explore the relationship between mass shooting, media attention, and public interest in gun control.


My three data sources are:
1. mass shooting data 2013-2017 http://www.shootingtracker.com/
2. media data https://mediacloud.org/
3. google search data https://trends.google.com/trends/
